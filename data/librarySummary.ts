        title: "When Breathe Becomes Air",
        author: "Paul Kalanithi",
        review:
          "Paul faced death with integrity. From his words, and his wife’s account, there were tears and anguish but he did not choose to avoid his difficult circumstance. He spent this time as a doctor merely aiming at slowing the pace of his patients’ journeys into death’s arms.  To slow his own pace, he chose to live in the moment with his newborn daughter and family. 10/10 would recommend.",

          "Wow! A memoir by Solomon Northup, this true-story retells how he was kidnapped and sold into the southern slave trade. He goes though unimaginable unfair treatment and cruelty while never losing his hope to go back to his family. This book has given me real perspective on a brutal period of history and made me reflect on how humans treat each other.",

This books explains how connected everything actually is and how dependent we are on nature. Although dry in some parts, this book is interesting as an ethic to an ecologically sustainable way of life.",
